I made this with more advanced CSS by using some properties that I never used them before. I googled a lot and I found the following here: css-tricks.com.

1) ::after : The ::after pseudo-elements in CSS allows you to insert content onto a page without it needing to be in the HTML.

2) :nth-child : The :nth-child selector allows you to select one or more elements based on their source order, according to a formula. 

3) em instead of rem : As Jeremy Church said: While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root) font-size.

4) object-fit: The object-fit property defines how an element responds to the height and width of its content box. Itâ€™s intended for images, videos and other embeddable media formats in conjunction with the object-position property. 

This is the preview I made:
